1,What is Artificial Intelligence?,Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.
2,What is Machine Learning?,Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
3,What is Deep Learning?,Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.
4,What is Natural Language Processing?,Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
5,What is a Neural Network?,A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain that consists of layers of interconnected nodes called neurons.
6,What is Supervised Learning?,Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data.
7,What is Unsupervised Learning?,Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that finds patterns in unlabeled data.
8,What is Reinforcement Learning?,Reinforcement learning is a training method where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
9,What are Embeddings?,Embeddings are dense vector representations of data such as text that capture semantic meaning.
10,What is a Vector Database?,A vector database is a database optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors for similarity search.
11,What is Cosine Similarity?,Cosine similarity measures how similar two vectors are by calculating the cosine of the angle between them.
12,What is Transfer Learning?,Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is adapted for a new but related task.
13,What is Overfitting?,Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.
14,What is Underfitting?,Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture underlying patterns in the data.
15,What is Large Language Model?,A large language model is a deep learning model trained on massive amounts of text data to generate human-like text.
